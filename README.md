# Overview
Welcome to my final project developed during my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) journey. This project marks the culmination of my learning and showcases a Study Dashboard created using React. The Study Dashboard is designed to provide users with a centralized platform to manage their study tasks and enhance their productivity.

# Problem Statement
The primary aim of this project is to address the challenge of efficiently organizing study materials and tasks for students. With the increasing demands of remote learning and information overload, students often struggle to keep track of their study goals and progress. The Study Dashboard seeks to provide a solution by offering an intuitive interface for users to manage their study schedules, set reminders, and track their progress.

# Features
- Task Management: Users can create, edit, and delete study tasks. The dashboard offers a user-friendly interface to organize tasks by priority, subject, and due dates.

- Reminders: The Study Dashboard includes a reminder feature that helps users set timely notifications for upcoming exams, assignments, and study sessions.

- Progress Tracking: Users can track their study progress over time using interactive charts and graphs, helping them visualize their achievements and areas for improvement.

- Music Player: The Study Dashboard integrates a music player that allows users to search for Spotify playlists and play songs within those playlists, providing an enjoyable study environment.

- Holiday Calendar: Stay updated with a built-in calendar that displays upcoming holidays in Australia, ensuring users can plan their study schedules accordingly.

# Data Model
The Study Dashboard's data model is built around a relational database schema. The database structure supports user accounts, study tasks, reminders, progress logs, music playlists, and holiday information. The schema ensures efficient data retrieval and storage to enhance the user experience.

# Cool Tech and Tools

- React: The frontend was built using React, allowing for efficient component-based UI development.

- Spotify API: Integration of the Spotify API empowered the music player functionality, enabling users to discover and enjoy music.

- Calendar API: The project leveraged a calendar API to display accurate holiday information for Australia.

- Express and Node.js: The backend was developed using Express and Node.js, providing a robust foundation for handling server-side operations and API requests.

- CSS: Custom CSS was used to style and enhance the visual aesthetics of the Study Dashboard, ensuring a polished and user-friendly interface.

- JSX: JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript, enabled the seamless integration of dynamic content and components within the React application, contributing to a dynamic user experience.

# Lessons Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into full-stack development, API integration, data modeling, and user-centric design. I learned the importance of effective communication between frontend and backend components and the significance of continuous testing and debugging to ensure a seamless user experience.

Thank you for exploring my Study Dashboard project! I hope you find it as valuable and useful as I did during its creation. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
